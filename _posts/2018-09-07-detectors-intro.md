Particle detectors - 
I love detectors ! They can measure whatever you want them to measure and work in any kinds of conditions and have all sorts of applications. Or course there has always been a push for making better detectors - achieving higher resolution, longer lifetime, measuring as many things at once as possible, etc.

During my graduate studies, I had a class on detectors in high energy physics and it was the best class ever. Thanks Dr. Vachon!

Anyway, I would like to start a little blog series on particle detectors with things like history, use and later applications in industry. It will be a great journal for myself and if anyone else is reading - welcome and let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Ok lets start with a detector number one - bubble chamber:

Part number 2:
