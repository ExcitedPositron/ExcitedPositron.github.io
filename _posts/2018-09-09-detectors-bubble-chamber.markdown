### Bubble chamber facts

* Invented when: 1952
* Invented by who: Donald A. Glaser
* What it does: detects charged particles moving through the detector

Bubble chambers are some of the most satisfying particle detectors. You can observe particles in real time with your own eyes, how cool is that? Since their invention they have been overtaken by other types of detectors that have better performance and aren't used in modern high energy physics experiments.

Aparently some of the earliest prototypes used beer as a medium which might have given the bubble chamber its name. I would like to know what prompted Donald A. Glaser to pour some beer into his newly constructed detector. Did he really just not want to share it with some colleagues? Anyway, he soon realized that liquid hydrogen will do much better and his lab could stop smelling like a pub again. 

The basic principle of bubble chamber is a container filled with a liquid at high pressure above its usual boiling temperature (most commonly used liquid hydrogen). When an electrically charged particle enters the detector, the detector volume is quickly increased, decreasing the pressure at the same time which leads to the liquid entering a superheated stage. A charged particle ionizes the superheated liquid (separates the positive and negative charges of an atom) and the ionization boils off some of the liquid, bubbles appear. Because the detector container is still expanding, the bubbles also increase in size and can be photographed from a camera facing the detector.

Bubble chambers were the successors of the cloud chambers.
