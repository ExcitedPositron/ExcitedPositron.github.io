### Bubble chamber facts

* Invented when: 1911
* Invented by who: Charles Thomson Rees Wilson
* What it does: detects charged particles moving through the detector

Bubble chambers are some of the most satisfying particle detectors. You can observe particles in real time with your own eyes, how cool is that? Since their invention they have been overtaken by other types of detectors that have better performance and aren't used in modern high energy physics experiments. 

The basic principle of bubble chamber is a container filled with a liquid at high pressure above its usual boiling temperature (most commonly used liquid hydrogen) which gets ionized by an electrically charged particle traversing it. (Ionization separates the positive and negative charges of an atom in the liquid )

A bubble chamber is a vessel filled with a superheated transparent liquid (most often liquid hydrogen) used to detect electrically charged particles moving through it. It was invented in 1952 by Donald A. Glaser,[1] for which he was awarded the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physics.[2] Supposedly, Glaser was inspired by the bubbles in a glass of beer; however, in a 2006 talk, he refuted this story, although saying that while beer was not the inspiration for the bubble chamber, he did experiments using beer to fill early prototypes.[3]
