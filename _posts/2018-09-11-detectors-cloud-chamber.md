### Cloud chamber facts

* Invented when: 1911
* Invented by who: Charles Thomson Rees Wilson
* What it does: detects charged particles moving through the detector

Cloud chambers are some of the most satisfying particle detectors. You can observe particles in real time with your own eyes, how cool is that? Since their invention they have been overtaken by other types of detectors that have better performance and aren't used in modern high energy physics experiments. 


What is most fun, you can make a cloud chamber yourself. Lots of people have made it for themselves. <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-make-a-Cloud-Chamber/">Here is one set of instructions.</a> These instructions are the easiest I could find, the trickiest part is to get dry ice.
