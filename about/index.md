Hi, I'm Helena I am a PhD student in accelerator physics. I was born in Czech Republic but lived in United States, Canada, UK, Japan and now in France so if you ask me where is my home, don't expect a short answer. I am an adventurer, book lover, board game enthousiast and sometimes a cauch potato.

Through this website, I will share random things about science, accelerator physcis, computing and more. Accelerator physics is a field of physics that is not as widely known to general public but it has so many applications. From high energy physics to medical imaging, from life sciences research to industrial applications, there are already thousands of accelerators around the world.
I will share some cool things I learn during my PhD with you because I believe as a scientist, I have a responsibility to make science less obscure. Everyone can understand complex theories and concepts if it is presented well. So I will also add my attempts to become a science communicator.

Feel free to contact me :)
