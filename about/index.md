Hi, I'm Helena I am a PhD student in accelerator physics. I was born in Czech Republic bu\
t lived in United States, Canada, UK, Japan and now in France so if you ask me where is m\
y home, don't expect a short answer. I am an adventurer, book lover, board game enthousia\
st and sometimes a cauch potato.

Through this website, I will share random things about science, accelerator physcis, comp\
uting and more. Accelerator physics is a field of physics that is not as widely known to \
general public but it has so many applications. From high energy physics to medical imagi\
ng, from life sciences research to industrial applications, there are already thousands o\
f accelerators around the world.
I will share some cool things I learn during my PhD with you because I believe as a scien\
tist, I have a responsibility to make science less obscure. Everyone can understand compl\
ex theories and concepts if it is presented well. So I will also add my attempts to becom\
e a science communicator.

Feel free to contact me :)
