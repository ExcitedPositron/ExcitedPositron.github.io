I love animations in presentations. They can make complex processes understandable while keeping the presentation entertaining. Lets look at this animation of electrical charges behavior. It shows the attraction of positive / negative charge and the repulsion of a positive / positive charge. It is a known concept to many so I think if it is a bit fun looking, even the very knowledgeble person can be at least amused.
